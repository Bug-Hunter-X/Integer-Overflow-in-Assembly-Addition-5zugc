# Integer Overflow Bug in Assembly

This repository demonstrates a potential integer overflow bug in a simple assembly code snippet that performs addition operations. The bug occurs when the sum of the operands exceeds the maximum value representable by the integer data type. This results in an incorrect result, potentially causing unexpected program behavior. The solution demonstrates how to mitigate this issue by checking for potential overflow before performing the addition.

## Bug Description
The assembly code adds two memory locations, adds a constant to one of them before adding them together, storing the result. Integer overflow is possible if the values are large enough to exceed the maximum representable value.

## Solution
The solution involves modifying the assembly code to check for potential overflow before performing the addition. This is done by comparing the operands before addition. If overflow occurs, the code sets a flag or handles the situation appropriately.
